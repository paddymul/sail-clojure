  hopefully with tactics estimator I can build a cute little dsl
  that looks somehting like this
  ((tack-port) 50 )  meaning go on a port tack and then 50 steps afterwards
  the great thing about this is, I can use this to estimate other boats progress too
  this will be helpfull with search based approaches to the problem

  I am enjoying the constraints of functional programing here

  maybe for right now this is a bit advanced something like tactics
  estimator should be built before I have a more advanced physics
  model in place

  right now physics are so dirt simple that I can model them quickly
  inside of lifted-tack that won't always be the case
