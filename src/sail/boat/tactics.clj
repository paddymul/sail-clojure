    "determines which tack will get us closer to the mark

   it does this by extrapolating how far from the mark you would be if
   you stayed on each tack for 10 * the boat movement figure, maybe it
   would be better to just compare the mark angle to the pointing
   angle???

   I'm worried that this function could end up oscilating very quickly
   so that the boat tacks back and forth without putting much time in
   on any one tack

   I think I could make it better by taking into account the current
   position, and how long we expect it to take to tack over to the
   other position

   then it becomes a comparison not of which tack will get us closer
   to the mark, but which course of actions in t+ x will get us closer
   to the mark

  I think I should make some optimize functions, these will be useful with tactics estimator
