# sail

This is my attempt at a sailing tactics simulator.  It is in a state of flux and is not idiomatic clojure code.

This is not a video game, but an exploration of AI for  racing sailing tactics

the really interesting files are boat.physics where I implement my
physics model.  Note I know that there is alot that I can do to make
the physics more accurate, it will get there.

the other interesting file is boat.tactics

the program basically works by telling the tactics function the
current state of the world.  the tactics function then returns the
rudder-angle, and notes, the notes are passed back to the tactics
function the next time it is called.  a boat physics function updates
the position of the boat.  By separating concerns in this way, the
tactics function cannot cheat.

## Usage

run lein swank
compile/run sail.core.  you will see an animation

## Installation

This depends on units  and clj-logo
